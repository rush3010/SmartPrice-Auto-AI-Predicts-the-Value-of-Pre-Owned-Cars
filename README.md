# Used Car Price Prediction
In this project, I proposed a supervised machine
learning model using various regression algorithm to predict the price of used cars.
We trained our model with data of used cars which is collected from the Kaggle website.

## Objective
To anlayze the data and predict the prices of used cars.

## Methodology
-Handled ouliers using flooring and capping method
-Converted Categorical Features using One-Hot-Encoding


## Libraries used

### Data Cleaning
Pandas, NumPy

### Data Visualization
Matplotlib.pylot and Seaborn

### Algorithms
LinearRegression, DecisionTreeRegressor and RandomForestRegressor

### Preformance Metrics
R2_score, mean _absolute_percentage_error(MAPE) and 
Root_mean_squared_error(RMSE)
