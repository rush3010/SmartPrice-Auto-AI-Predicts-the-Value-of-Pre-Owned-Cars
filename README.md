# SmartPrice Auto: AI Predicts the Value of Pre-Owned Cars

### Project Overview
SmartPrice Auto is a machine learning project developed to predict the price of pre-owned cars based on key features such as make, model, age, mileage, and more. The primary objective of this project is to provide a robust predictive model that helps estimate used car prices, enhancing decision-making in the automotive market.

### Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Algorithms**: Multiple regression models including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, and Random Forests

### Project Highlights
- **Extensive Data Cleaning & EDA**: Ensured high-quality data by performing thorough data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA), which included handling missing values, outliers, and data transformations.
- **Model Training & Evaluation**: Implemented various regression algorithms and evaluated their performance using key metrics such as R-squared, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
- **Algorithm Analysis**: Conducted a comparative analysis of the algorithms' strengths and weaknesses, leading to an informed selection of the best model for accurate price predictions.
- **Real-World Application**: Demonstrated the practical application of machine learning in solving real-world problems related to the automotive market, providing insights into the factors that most significantly impact car pricing.

### Results
After rigorous testing, the best-performing model was selected based on evaluation metrics, showcasing its ability to predict car prices with a high degree of accuracy. The insights gained from this analysis not only improved model performance but also provided a deeper understanding of the data.

### Key Learnings
- The importance of data preprocessing for model reliability.
- How different regression models respond to various data features.
- Using comparative analysis to select the optimal algorithm for specific predictive tasks.
